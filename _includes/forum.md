Sharism Forum
=============

The Sharism Forum features talks and panel discussions by thinkers, practitioners and activists whose work concerns and shapes the global movement of a new sharing culture, which has been unified under the concept of SHARISM. The public at large is invited to join and to become a shareholder of this movement. These events spark calls-to-action and demonstrate new modalities and technologies of sharing. If you are interested in helping us organize the next Sharism Forum, please [email the Sharism team](mailto:info@sharism.org).
