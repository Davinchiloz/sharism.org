Sharism Presents
================

Sharism is coming to your city.
-------------------------------

Sharism Presents are events where sharing is encouraged. It's not show and tell, but more of show up and share. Sharism Presents are gifts of knowledge. Events are for all those interested in sharing and are informal. People are encouraged to introduce themselves at the beginning with what they are sharing at the meeting, and then the entire event is ad-hoc in development. If you are interested in hosting a Sharism Presents, please [email the Sharism team](mailto:info@sharism.org).
